'''
Write a generator that yields one filename at a time from /etc/httpd/logs/access_log

'''


#In the result, home directory (i.e. /) is counted as filename 
#because that is where a user accessed.
#If we do not count home directory as filename, then we just add
# “and parts[6] != '/' “  into filter and exclude home directory from the result. 
#Other, than that, generator is pretty straight forward.
